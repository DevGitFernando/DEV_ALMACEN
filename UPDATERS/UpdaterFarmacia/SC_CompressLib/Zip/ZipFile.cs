// This module is part of DotNetZip, a zipfile class library. 
// The class library reads and writes zip files, according to the format
// described by PKware, at:
// http://www.pkware.com/business_and_developers/developer/popups/appnote.txt
//
// This implementation was originally based on the
// System.IO.Compression.DeflateStream base class in the .NET Framework
// v2.0 base class library, but now includes a managed-code port of Zlib.
//
// There are other Zip class libraries available.  For example, it is
// possible to read and write zip files within .NET via the J# runtime.
// But some people don't like to install the extra DLL.  Also, there is
// a 3rd party LGPL-based (or is it GPL?) library called SharpZipLib,
// which works, in both .NET 1.1 and .NET 2.0.  But some people don't
// like the GPL, and some people say it's complicated and slow. 
// Finally, there are commercial tools (From ComponentOne,
// XCeed, etc).  But some people don't want to incur the cost.
//
// This alternative implementation is not GPL licensed, is free of cost,
// and does not require J#. It does require .NET 2.0 .
// 
// This code is released under the Microsoft Public License . 
// See the License.txt for details.  
//
// Bugs:
// 1. no support for reading or writing multi-disk zip archives
// 2. no support for asynchronous operation
